*Pre* and *Code* styling is included and **PrettyPrint** is an additional option that you can toggle on or off in the theme settings. Turning PrettyPrint off will keep the CSS and JS from loading on your page.

```prettyprint
---
title: My New Page
---
# My New Page!

This is the body of **my new page** and I can easily use _Markdown_ syntax here.
```

```prettyprint
<div>
	<p>Markup with <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/" target="_blank">prettyprint</a></p>
</div>
```

To add the style class for [PrettyPrint](https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/), you just need to add `prettyprint` directly after the top code fence:

<pre class="sg-highlight-dark">
```prettyprint
 &lt;Your Code Here /&gt;
```
</pre>
